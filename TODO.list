This is TODO list

1. Add some methods in <class ProtocolMeta>, such as get_protocol_hierarchy(),
   get_all_protocol_methods(), etc.

2. Improve test. There should be a Test/ folder with *.py for seperate
   functional testing.

3. Add functionality, that could extract protocols from a jointer, and inject
   these protocols into another object.
   
4. Compatibility issues: i) get_callables() on pandas.DataFrame.
                        ii) method_descriptor such as str.ljust.
